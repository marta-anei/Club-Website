      <h2>"Her poems make me think of childhood, they take me to the good times I had playing in the golden wheat fields or perched on top of the hay cart. A medicine for the heart that longs for lost memories."</h2>

      <h2>My Grandmother had everything</h2>
      <p>'My Grandmother had everything: <br>
          She had a porch with Geraniums,<br>
          She had a fountain, bread, and salt,<br>
          She had the strength, patience and all.<br>
          She had faith and she had love,<br>
          And a great longing for salvation,<br>
          She had a horse tied to a cart,<br>
          And the good cow's beloved white potion.<br>
          She had countless stories of the life,<br>
          And unsung songs of bravest hearts,<br>
          Which she often told out slowly,<br>
          At corvees and evening sittings.'<br>
